# PartialPropertyTest

This class demonstrates that partial properties are now supported in .NET 9 and C# 13.

## Remarks

This test proves that we can now implement property-level documentation generation in the MarkdownDocsGenerator, as partial properties are fully supported. This was previously not possible in earlier versions of C#.

## Properties

### TestProperty

A test property demonstrating partial property support.

#### Value
