# Update XMLDocs Generation - Add Property Level Documentation

## Status: NOT FEASIBLE
This task has been determined to be not feasible with C# 13 due to language limitations.

### Technical Blocker
Error CS9250: A partial property may not have multiple defining declarations, and cannot be an auto-property.

This means we cannot generate documentation for properties in a separate partial class declaration like we do for methods, as C# does not support partial properties or multiple declarations of auto-properties.

## Original Requirements (For Reference)

### Property Documentation Format
- Support property documentation in markdown files under a "Properties" section
- Each property should have:
  - A description
  - A "Value" subsection explaining the property's value
- Example format in markdown:
```markdown
## Properties

### PropertyName
Description of the property

#### Value
Description of the property's value
```

### Alternative Approaches to Consider
1. Document properties in the same file where they are declared
2. Generate documentation in a separate format (e.g., separate documentation files)
3. Wait for future C# versions that might support partial properties
4. Use a different approach for property documentation that doesn't rely on partial classes

## Conclusion
This task needs to be reconsidered with a different technical approach that works within C#'s current limitations regarding property declarations.
