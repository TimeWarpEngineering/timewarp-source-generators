# Create Hello World Source Generator

## Description
Create a placeholder source generator that outputs diagnostic information to verify the source generation pipeline is working correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create basic source generator project structure
- [ ] Implement minimal source generator that outputs diagnostic information
- [ ] Verify diagnostics appear in build output
- [ ] Add example of how to debug the source generator

## Notes
This will serve as a proof-of-concept for source generation capabilities.
