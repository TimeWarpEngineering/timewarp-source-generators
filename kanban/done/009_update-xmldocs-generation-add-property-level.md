# Update XMLDocs Generation - Add Property Level Documentation

## Status: COMPLETED (2025-08-02)
This task has been completed using C# 14 preview features with the `field` keyword.

### Completion Summary
- ✅ Implemented property-level documentation generation using partial properties
- ✅ Source generator now generates implementing declarations with the `field` keyword
- ✅ Developer writes simple defining declarations like `public partial string Prop { get; set; }`
- ✅ Generator creates implementation with XML documentation
- ✅ Properly handles nullable reference types
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in `documentation/developer/conceptual/partial-properties-field-keyword.md`

⚠️ **Note**: This uses C# 14 preview features that may change before the November 2025 release.

### Update (2025-08-01)
Partial properties ARE now supported in .NET 9! Testing confirms that we can have:
- A declaration part: `public partial string TestProperty { get; set; }`
- An implementation part with actual getter/setter logic

This means we can now generate property documentation in the same way we generate method documentation.

See `tests/timewarp-source-generators-test-console/partial-property-test.cs` for a working example of partial properties.

## Original Requirements (For Reference)

### Property Documentation Format
- Support property documentation in markdown files under a "Properties" section
- Each property should have:
  - A description
  - A "Value" subsection explaining the property's value
- Example format in markdown:
```markdown
## Properties

### PropertyName
Description of the property

#### Value
Description of the property's value
```

## Current Status (2025-08-01) - START HERE FOR NEW SESSION

### What's Been Completed
1. ✅ Confirmed partial properties ARE supported in .NET 9
2. ✅ Created test file: `tests/timewarp-source-generators-test-console/partial-property-test.cs`
3. ✅ Created markdown: `tests/timewarp-source-generators-test-console/partial-property-test.md` 
4. ✅ Proven the technical approach is now feasible

### What Still Needs Implementation
1. Update `source/timewarp-source-generators/markdown-docs-generator.cs` to:
   - Extract PropertyDeclarationSyntax from class members (currently only extracts methods at line 94-99)
   - Add property signatures dictionary similar to methodSignatures
   - Parse "Properties" section from markdown (after line 106 where it checks for "## Methods")
   - Generate partial property declarations in the output

### Key Implementation Details
- Property declaration syntax: `public partial string PropertyName { get; set; }`
- Properties need BOTH declaration (in generated file) and implementation (in user's file)
- Look at existing method handling code:
  - Lines 92-99: How methods are extracted
  - Lines 108-163: How method sections are parsed
  - Lines 234-287: How method documentation is generated

### Markdown Format for Properties
```markdown
## Properties

### PropertyName
Description of the property

#### Value
Description of the property's value
```

### Files to Reference
- **Main file to modify**: `source/timewarp-source-generators/markdown-docs-generator.cs`
- **Test files created**: 
  - `tests/timewarp-source-generators-test-console/partial-property-test.cs`
  - `tests/timewarp-source-generators-test-console/partial-property-test.md`
- **Example with properties**: `tests/timewarp-source-generators-test-console/test-class.cs` 
  - Has properties: MaxLength, ProcessedCount, LastMessage
  - Currently these properties are NOT documented

### Technical Implementation Notes
1. Add property extraction:
   ```csharp
   var propertySignatures = classDeclaration.Members
       .OfType<PropertyDeclarationSyntax>()
       .ToDictionary(
           p => p.Identifier.Text,
           p => $"public partial {p.Type} {p.Identifier} {{ get; set; }}"
       );
   ```

2. Parse Properties section similar to Methods section

3. Generate property declarations with XML docs similar to ProcessMethodSection

4. The generated properties will be partial declarations that match the user's implementation

### Testing Plan
1. Update TestClass.md to include Properties section for existing properties
2. Verify generated documentation includes property XML docs
3. Ensure compilation succeeds with partial properties
